description: "Turn any codebase into a beautiful, interactive single-page HTML course that teaches how the code works to non-technical people. Use this skill whenever someone wants to create an interactive course, tutorial, or educational walkthrough from a codebase or project. Also trigger when users mention 'turn this into a course,' 'explain this codebase interactively,' 'teach this code,' 'interactive tutorial from code,' 'codebase walkthrough,' 'learn from this codebase,' or 'make a course from this project.' This skill produces a stunning, self-contained HTML file with scroll-based navigation, animated visualizations, embedded quizzes, and code-with-plain-English side-by-side translations."

# Codebase-to-Course

**语言要求：所有课程内容（标题、正文、按钮、提示、测验题目和选项、代码注释翻译等）必须使用中文输出。代码片段本身保留原文，但代码旁边的翻译和解释用中文。**

Transform any codebase into a stunning, interactive course. The output is a **directory** containing a pre-built `styles.css`, `main.js`, per-module HTML files, and an assembled `index.html` — open it directly in the browser with no setup required (only external dependency: Google Fonts CDN). The course teaches how the code works through scroll-based modules, animated visualizations, embedded quizzes, and plain-Chinese translations of code.

## First-Run Welcome

When the skill is first triggered and the user hasn't specified a codebase yet, introduce yourself and explain what you do:

> **I can turn any codebase into an interactive course that teaches how it works — no coding knowledge required.**
>
> Just point me at a project:
> - **A local folder** — e.g., "turn ./my-project into a course"
> - **A GitHub link** — e.g., "make a course from https://github.com/user/repo"
> - **The current project** — if you're already in a codebase, just say "turn this into a course"
>
> I'll read through the code, figure out how everything fits together, and generate a beautiful single-page HTML course with animated diagrams, plain-Chinese code explanations, and interactive quizzes. The whole thing runs in your browser — no setup needed.

If the user provides a GitHub link, clone the repo first (`git clone <url> /tmp/<repo-name>`) before starting the analysis. If they say "this codebase" or similar, use the current working directory.

## Who This Is For

The learner is a **"vibe coder"** — builds software by instructing AI in natural language, no CS background. They've used the app but don't know how it works under the hood. They want coding as a superpower, not to become engineers: they need to *read*, *understand*, and *direct* code, not write it from scratch.

**Four hard rules that follow from this:**
1. **Assume zero technical background.** Explain every concept — variables, APIs, databases — in plain language. No jargon without a definition. Tone = smart friend, not professor.
2. **Every module answers "why should I care?" before "how does it work?"** The answer is always practical: this helps you steer AI, debug, or make architectural decisions.
3. **The vocabulary IS the learning.** Teach the precise terms (e.g. "namespace package" not "shared folder thing") so learners can describe requirements clearly to AI agents.
4. **Teach by tracing the known.** Start from what the learner already does ("you know that button you click? here's what happens under the hood"), then peel back layers. Build-first, understand-later — the inverse of traditional CS education.

The directory-based output is intentional: separating CSS/JS from content means AI never regenerates boilerplate, each module is written independently (keeping output size small and quality high), and the assembled `index.html` works offline with zero setup.

## The Process

### Phase 1: Codebase Analysis

Before writing course HTML, deeply understand the codebase. Read all the key files, trace the data flows, identify the "cast of characters" (main components/modules), and map how they communicate. Thoroughness here pays off — the more you understand, the better the course.

**What to extract:**
- The main "actors" (components, services, modules) and their responsibilities
- The primary user journey (what happens when someone uses the app end-to-end)
- Key APIs, data flows, and communication patterns
- Clever engineering patterns (caching, lazy loading, error handling, etc.)
- Real bugs or gotchas (if visible in git history or comments)
- The tech stack and why each piece was chosen

**Figure out what the app does yourself** by reading the README, the main entry points, and the UI code. Don't ask the user to explain the product — they may not be familiar with it either. The course should open by explaining what the app does in plain language (a brief "here's what this thing does and why it's interesting") before diving into how it works. The first module should start with a concrete user action — "imagine you paste a YouTube URL and click Analyze — here's what happens under the hood."

### Phase 2: Curriculum Design

Structure the course as **4-6 modules**. Most courses need 4-6. Only go to 7-8 if the codebase genuinely has that many distinct concepts worth teaching. Fewer, better modules beat more, thinner ones.

The arc always starts from what the learner already knows (the user-facing behavior) and moves toward what they don't (the code underneath). Think of it as zooming in: start wide with the experience, then progressively peel back layers.

| Module Position | Purpose | Why it matters for a vibe coder |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | "Here's what this app does — and what happens when you use it" | Start with the product (what it does, why it's interesting), then trace a core user action into the code. Grounds everything in something concrete. |
| 2 | Meet the actors | Know which components exist so you can tell AI "put this logic in X, not Y" |
| 3 | How the pieces talk | Understand data flow so you can debug "it's not showing up" problems |
| 4 | The outside world (APIs, databases) | Know what's external so you can evaluate costs, rate limits, and failure modes |
| 5 | The clever tricks | Learn patterns (caching, chunking, error handling) so you can request them from AI |
| 6 | When things break | Build debugging intuition so you can escape AI bug loops |
| 7 | The big picture | See the full architecture so you can make better decisions about what to build next |

This is a **menu, not a checklist**. Pick the modules that serve the codebase — a simple CLI tool needs 4, not 7. Adapt the arc to the codebase's complexity.

**The key principle:** Every module should connect back to a practical skill — steering AI, debugging, making decisions. If a module doesn't help the learner DO something better, cut it or reframe it until it does.

**Each module should contain:**
- 3-6 screens (sub-sections that flow within the module)
- At least one code-with-English translation
- At least one interactive element (quiz, visualization, or animation)
- One or two "aha!" callout boxes with universal CS insights
- A metaphor that grounds the technical concept in everyday life — but NEVER reuse the same metaphor across modules, and NEVER default to the "restaurant" metaphor (it's overused). Pick metaphors that organically fit the specific concept. The best metaphors feel *inevitable* for the concept, not forced.

**Mandatory interactive elements (every course must include ALL of these):**
- **Group Chat Animation** — at least one across the course. These are the iMessage/WeChat-style conversations between components. They're one of the most engaging elements and must always appear, even if you have to creatively frame a module's concept as a conversation between actors.
- **Message Flow / Data Flow Animation** — at least one across the course. The step-by-step packet animation between actors. If the codebase has any kind of request/response, data pipeline, or multi-step process, animate it. Every codebase has data flowing somewhere — find it.
- **Code ↔ English Translation Blocks** — at least one per module (already required above, but reiterating: this is non-negotiable).
- **Quizzes** — at least one per module (multiple-choice, scenario, drag-and-drop, or spot-the-bug — any quiz type counts).
- **Glossary Tooltips** — on every technical term, first use per module.

These five element types are the backbone of every course. Other interactive elements (architecture diagrams, layer toggles, pattern cards, etc.) are optional and should be added when they fit. But the five above must ALWAYS be present — no exceptions.

**Do NOT present the curriculum for approval — just build it.** The user wants a course, not a planning document. Design the curriculum internally, then go straight to building. If they want changes, they'll tell you after seeing the result.

**After designing the curriculum, decide which build path to use:**

- **Simple codebase** (single-purpose CLI, small web app, library, one clear entry point, 5 or fewer modules) → go directly to Phase 3 Sequential.
- **Complex codebase** (full-stack app, multiple services, content-heavy site, monorepo, or 6+ modules) → go to Phase 2.5 first, then Phase 3 Parallel.

### Phase 2.5: Module Briefs (complex codebases only)

For complex codebases, write a brief for each module before writing any HTML. This is the critical step that enables parallel writing — each brief gives an agent everything it needs without re-reading the codebase.

Read `references/module-brief-template.md` for the template structure. Read `references/content-philosophy.md` for the content rules that should guide brief writing.

**For each module, write a brief to `/root/code/codebase-to-course/project/course-name/briefs/0N-slug.md` containing:**
- Teaching arc (metaphor, opening hook, key insight)
- Pre-extracted code snippets (copy-pasted from the codebase with file paths and line numbers)
- Interactive elements checklist with enough detail to build them
- Which sections of which reference files the writing agent needs
- What the previous and next modules cover (for transitions)

The code snippets are the critical token-saving step. By pre-extracting them into the brief, writing agents never need to read the codebase at all.

### Phase 3: Build the Course

The course output is a **directory**, not a single file. All CSS and JS are pre-built reference files — never regenerate them. Your job is to write only the HTML content.

**Output root:** All courses are generated under `/root/code/codebase-to-course/project/`. Replace `course-name` below with the actual course slug.

**Output structure:**
```
/root/code/codebase-to-course/project/course-name/
  styles.css       ← copied verbatim from references/styles.css
  main.js          ← copied verbatim from references/main.js
  _base.html       ← customized shell (title, accent color, nav dots)
  _footer.html     ← copied verbatim from references/_footer.html
  build.sh         ← copied verbatim from references/build.sh
  briefs/          ← module briefs (complex codebases only, can delete after build)
  modules/
    01-intro.html
    02-actors.html
    ...
  index.html       ← assembled by build.sh (do not write manually)
```

**Step 1 (both paths): Setup** — Create the course directory under `/root/code/codebase-to-course/project/course-name/`. Copy these four files verbatim using Read + Write (do not regenerate their contents):
- `references/styles.css` → `/root/code/codebase-to-course/project/course-name/styles.css`
- `references/main.js` → `/root/code/codebase-to-course/project/course-name/main.js`
- `references/_footer.html` → `/root/code/codebase-to-course/project/course-name/_footer.html`
- `references/build.sh` → `/root/code/codebase-to-course/project/course-name/build.sh`

**Step 2 (both paths): Customize `_base.html`** — Read `references/_base.html`, then write it to `/root/code/codebase-to-course/project/course-name/_base.html` with exactly two substitutions:
- Both instances of `COURSE_TITLE` → the actual course title
- The four `ACCENT_*` placeholders → the chosen accent color values (pick one palette from the comments in `_base.html`)

**Leave `NAV_DOTS` as-is** — `main.js` generates nav dots automatically at load time by scanning the `.module` sections (it uses each module's `.module-title`, or an optional `data-nav-title="short title"` on the `<section>` for a shorter tooltip). You never hand-write nav dots. This means nav dots can never drift out of sync with the modules.

**Step 3: Write modules** — This is where the paths diverge.

#### Sequential path (simple codebases)

**First, sketch a mini-brief per module** (a few lines, can live in your working notes — no separate file needed): the metaphor, which 1-2 code snippets it uses (with file path + line numbers), and which interactive element carries it. This front-loads the hard thinking so later modules don't thin out, and means you don't re-scan the codebase to locate snippets while writing. (Complex codebases use the full `module-brief-template.md` instead — see Phase 2.5.)

**Naming rule:** Module files must be named `0N-slug.html` (zero-padded two-digit number, e.g. `01-intro.html`, `02-actors.html`). `build.sh` concatenates `modules/*.html` in glob order, so the numeric prefix is what keeps modules in the right sequence — and `0N` must match the section's `id="module-N"` (prefix `01` → `id="module-1"`).

Read `references/content-philosophy.md` and `references/gotchas.md`. Then write modules one at a time. For each module, write `/root/code/codebase-to-course/project/course-name/modules/0N-slug.html` containing only the `<section class="module" id="module-N">` block and its contents. Do not include `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, `<style>`, or `<script>` tags.

Read `references/interactive-elements.md` for HTML patterns for each interactive element type. Read `references/design-system.md` for visual conventions.

#### Parallel path (complex codebases)

Dispatch modules to subagents in batches of up to 3. Each agent receives:
- Its module brief (from `/root/code/codebase-to-course/project/course-name/briefs/`)
- `references/content-philosophy.md` and `references/gotchas.md`
- Only the sections of `references/interactive-elements.md` and `references/design-system.md` listed in the brief

Each agent writes its module file(s) to `/root/code/codebase-to-course/project/course-name/modules/`. Short modules (3 screens, one quiz) can be paired — two briefs given to one agent.

**What agents do NOT receive:** the full codebase (snippets are in the brief), SKILL.md, other modules' briefs, or unneeded reference file sections.

After all agents finish, do a quick consistency check in the main context: transitions between modules are coherent, no obvious tone shifts. (Nav dots auto-generate from modules at load time, so they need no manual sync check.)

**Step 4 (both paths): Assemble** — Run `build.sh` from the course directory:
```bash
cd /root/code/codebase-to-course/project/course-name && bash build.sh
```
This produces `index.html`. Open it in the browser.

**Critical rules:**
- **Never regenerate** `styles.css` or `main.js` — always copy from references
- Module files contain only `<section>` content — no boilerplate
- Use CSS `scroll-snap-type: y proximity` (NOT `mandatory`)
- Use `min-height: 100dvh` with `100vh` fallback on `.module`
- Interactive element JS is in `main.js`; wire up via `data-*` attributes and CSS class names as shown in `references/interactive-elements.md`
- Chat containers need `id` attributes; flow animations need `data-steps='[...]'` JSON on `.flow-animation`

### Phase 4: Review and Open

After running `build.sh`, open `index.html` in the browser. Walk the user through what was built and ask for feedback on content, design, and interactivity.

## Design Identity

The visual design should feel like a **beautiful developer notebook** — warm, inviting, and distinctive. Read `references/design-system.md` for the full token system, but here are the non-negotiable principles:

- **Warm palette**: Off-white backgrounds (like aged paper), warm grays, NO cold whites or blues
- **Bold accent**: One confident accent color (vermillion, coral, teal — NOT purple gradients)
- **Distinctive typography**: Display font with personality for headings (Bricolage Grotesque, or similar bold geometric face — NEVER Inter, Roboto, Arial, or Space Grotesk). Clean sans-serif for body (DM Sans or similar). JetBrains Mono for code.
- **Generous whitespace**: Modules breathe. Max 3-4 short paragraphs per screen.
- **Alternating backgrounds**: Even/odd modules alternate between two warm background tones for visual rhythm
- **Dark code blocks**: IDE-style with Catppuccin-inspired syntax highlighting on deep indigo-charcoal (#1E1E2E)
- **Depth without harshness**: Subtle warm shadows, never black drop shadows

## Reference Files

The `references/` directory contains detailed specs. **Read them only when you reach the relevant phase** — not upfront. This keeps context lean.

- **`references/content-philosophy.md`** — Visual density rules, metaphor guidelines, quiz design, tooltip rules, code translation guidance. Read during Phase 2.5 (briefs) and Phase 3 (writing modules).
- **`references/gotchas.md`** — Common failure points checklist. Read during Phase 3 and Phase 4 (review).
- **`references/module-brief-template.md`** — Template for Phase 2.5 module briefs. Read only for complex codebases using the parallel path.
- **`references/design-system.md`** — Complete CSS custom properties, color palette, typography scale, spacing system, shadows, animations, scrollbar styling. Read during Phase 3 when writing module HTML.
- **`references/interactive-elements.md`** — Implementation patterns for every interactive element: drag-and-drop quizzes, multiple-choice quizzes, code↔English translations, group chat animations, message flow visualizations, architecture diagrams, pattern cards, callout boxes. Read the relevant sections during Phase 3.
